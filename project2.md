## Project description

For this project we are trying to find the Minimum Overlap of sets that still cover all
points. For example, say we have multiple group projects for our class that needed to be presented
at the end of the semester. Your professor must grade every student at least once, but want to
minimize the number of total grades that must be performed. Your professor does not mind grading
multiple projects. Due to the nature of the projects, students are members of multiple projects, but
only want to present once. How can we minimize the number of times a student has to present?
Everyone in a group has to present (no partial group presentations.) and a grade must be assigned
for each group member. (From project description provided by professor)


## How to compiles / run the program

```bash
./min-overlap-test data/(datafile).set yes "set of number delimited by spaces"
```

## UI Design
When a user want to change the ouput recieved they must change what datafile they use when they type "make (datafile)".

## 3. Additional Considerations
In how to compile the datafiles are located in the data folder and in the release, and you can but any set of numbers delimted by spaces between each number for example the sets: "1 2 3 4" "5 6 7" "2 5 6 4".
