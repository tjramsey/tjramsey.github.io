## Project description

In this project I was tasked to create multiple interconnected databases that would allow users functionality such as creating new entries in certain databases and having each database connected to another one. This project was completed using Oracle Apex and a diagram creation tool, in order to create the ER diagram showing the connections between the databases.

## How to compiles / run the program

Login in to Oracle Apex
Press the Run Application button

## UI Design

The project is designed so that users can navigate to separate pages by selecting the options on the left side of the pages for the database. Also on select pages it provides a button, at the top right-hand corner, that brings the user to a dialogue box in order to create a new entry into the database.

## 3. Additional Considerations

I no longer have access to the Oracle Apex website in order to change anything with the code, such as for the header comment.
