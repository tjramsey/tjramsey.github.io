## Project description

In this project I was tasked to create multiple interconnected databases that would allow users functionality such as creating new entries in the database and having each database connected to another one. This project was completed using Oracle Apex and a diagram creation tool.

## How to compiles / run the program

Login in to Oracle Apex
Press the Run Application button

## UI Design

The project is designed so that users can navigate to separate pages by selecting the options on the left side of the pages for the database. Also on select pages it provides a button, at the top right-hand corner, that brings the user to a dialogue box in order to create a new entry into the database.

## 3. Additional Considerations

There was not enough time to do fancy things with the UI of the project.
