## Project description

Create a simple HTML parser to check if the HTML tags are balanced, and find the number of webpages you can visit from each page.

## How to compiles / run the program

```bash
cd ./html-test
```

## UI Design

There is no implemented user interface. In order to change output you must change the code in the main.cpp file where the tests are commented out.

## 3. Additional Considerations
The vscode file should be renamed .vscode, but github would not let me upload it since the folder was hidden. In test the word "correct" is corresponding to if it follows the example output.
