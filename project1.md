## Project description

In this project my partner and I had to demonstrate our understandings of protocols used for computer networks by implementing a of sending and receiving messages between different players in a multiplayer game. With this we had to check if the player's was hit, in order to update the players health, updating the player's position and sending that position to the other players in order for the players to be moving on each other's screen, and testing if the player has quit afterwich it will cause the player to disappear from all the other players games.

## How to compiles / run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

## 3. Additional Considerations

There is a lack of screenshots because I need multiple computers with the proper software to test the code completely.
