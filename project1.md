## Project description

In this project my partner and I had to demonstrate our understandings of protocols used for computer networks by implementing a of sending and receiving messages between different players in a multiplayer game. With this we had to check if the player's was hit, in order to update the players health, updating the player's position and sending that position to the other players in order for the players to be moving on each other's screen, and testing if the player has quit afterwich it will cause the player to disappear from all the other players games.

## How to compiles / run the program

```bash
./League.out
```

## UI Design

When the program is first run it will ask the user to select a character. Afterwards it will ask for the user to input a name and press enter. It will then show the user the gameboard with the character and other player's characters if those players are on the same network. The characters movements are controlled through mouse clicks and attacks are controlled by the keys WASDXQEZC. When a players health reaches 0 they lose, and a player can quit by pressign the escape button.

## 3. Additional Considerations

There is only one character on screen since I do not have multiple computers to run program. Currently attacking does not work since source-code provided by professor needed to be changed in order for it to work.
